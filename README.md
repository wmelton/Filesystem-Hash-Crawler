# [Filesystem-Hach-Crawler] (https://github.com/marcelernst/Filesystem-Hach-Crawler)

Crawls over your web server filesystem, generates file hashes and compare it 
with an previous generated master hash.
If there are hash-differences, the script will send you an notification via email.
You can be sure, that your web server was hacked with an code injection.

You can use this for example with an crownjob once a day.

To generate a master-hash-file, call index.php?generateMaster
